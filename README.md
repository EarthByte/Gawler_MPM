# Gawler Craton Mineral Prospectivity Mapping

This repository provides supplementary materials for the paper entitled 'Machine learning-based framework for prospectivity mapping of critical minerals'. In this paper, we proposed a new framework based on novel machine learning algorithms to address different challenges of mapping prospective zones of critical minerals. We investigated three different commodities in Gawler Craton, South Australia, including cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni) which are critical to electric vehicles and battery industries. The relevant notebooks for generating prospectivity maps are 'Gawler_MPM_Co', 'Gawler_MPM_Cr', and 'Gawler_MPM_Ni'. One of the novel methods used in the framework is SMOTE-GAN, which helps generate synthetic positive samples due to the low number of known target mineral occurrences in the study area. The relevant notebook is called 'SMOTE-GAN'.
